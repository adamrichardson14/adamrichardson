                I recently launched this website and a Youtube channel which will be used to share
                code and teach building full stack websites from real applications that we're
                working on. Below you will see my tech stack which is what you can expect to see
                courses on in the very near future.

                I use other frameworks and tech for smaller side projects and experimenting for fun,
                however this is my main stack and what I believe I can teach to a good level to help
                aspiring developers.

                Frontend
              </h3>
              <p>
                I've been working with React for a number of years now and will use it for pretty
                much every project. Next.js is my favourite React framework and I use Tailwindcss
                for styling websites. For smaller individual projects I will use Javascript over
                Typescript.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-200 sm:text-2xl mt-2">
                Backend
              </h3>
              <p>
                This one is dependant on the project and this changes quite a lot. For simple
                projects I've used a lot of headless CMS's and I feel my favourite is Sanity. I
                enjoy using Strapi and Keystone too.
              </p>
              <p>
                For more complex integrations I would integrate with my own database via an API.
                I've extensively used MySQL and Postgres, along with Mongodb and Firebase Firestore.
                For data that isn't heavily relational I would probably opt for either Firebase or
                Mongodb depending on complexiy. For relational data I would definitely go with
                Postgres.
              </p>

              <p>This is what I will default to for larger applications.</p>

                <li>Typescript</li>
                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  I really love using Typescript on larger codebases/projects, especially when
                  working with others.

                </li>
                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  The current project we're working on is built with Next.js API routes solely. This
                  is actually working very well with next-auth and Prisma.

                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  Huge huge fan of Prisma and I'm confident using this in production projects now.
                  Developer experience is top notch for larger scale projects and being fully typed
                  is amazing for larger projects.
